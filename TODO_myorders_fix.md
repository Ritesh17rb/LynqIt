# My Orders Owner Section Fix

## Problem
The my-orders route is not working correctly in the owner section. The issue stems from inconsistent data structures: for users, `shopOrders` is an array, but for owners, it's a single object. This causes errors in filtering past/pending orders and updating statuses.

## Root Cause
- Backend returns `shopOrders` as a single object for owners in `getMyOrders`.
- Socket emits `shopOrders` as a single object.
- Frontend logic assumes `shopOrders` is an array for both roles, leading to `.some()` and `.find()` failures on objects.

## Solution
Standardize `shopOrders` as an array for both users and owners.

### Backend Changes
1. In `order.controllers.js` `getMyOrders` for owner: Wrap the found shopOrder in an array.
2. In `placeOrder` and `verifyPayment`: Emit `shopOrders` as an array `[shopOrder]`.

### Frontend Changes
1. In `MyOrders.jsx`: Update socket listener to check `data.shopOrders[0]?.owner._id`.
2. In `OwnerOrderCard.jsx`: Access `data.shopOrders[0]` instead of `data.shopOrders`.
3. In `userSlice.js`: Ensure `updateOrderStatus` works with array (already does).

## Steps
- [ ] Update backend `getMyOrders` for owner to return `shopOrders` as array.
- [ ] Update backend socket emits in `placeOrder` and `verifyPayment` to send `shopOrders` as array.
- [ ] Update frontend socket listener in `MyOrders.jsx`.
- [ ] Update `OwnerOrderCard.jsx` to access `data.shopOrders[0]`.
- [ ] Test the owner my-orders functionality.
